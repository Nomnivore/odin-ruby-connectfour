# Connect Four

Connect 4 Project for The Odin Project, part of the Ruby Programming course.

Command Line Connect 4 game using TDD with Rspec.

Definitely not my best code, but the objective of the assignment was to learn how to use Rspec and Test-Driven-Development. This project provided me with valuable experience in those things.
